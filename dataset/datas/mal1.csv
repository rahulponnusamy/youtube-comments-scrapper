0,"Basically, what I think is that, the very reason behind the formation of such a question of, ""Is homosexuality right?"", is that people think that heterosexuality is the default one and that is right. What I feel is that there is nothing such as right or wrong when it comes to sexuality or sexual orientations. The facts that all these differences do exist and people find happiness and peace in their choices are a big fat explanation for the very question. As long as the two people do know what they are doing, and there is consent and nobody is being hurt who cares???",31,3 months ago (edited),https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHpw88BTDiR901-Dl8oInRg,Shiva Darsana R.

STDs do not discriminate on straights :P . Mainly STDs seem to spread because of having unprotected sex with multiple partners. Homosexuals seem to have multiple partners, why? Because their relationships are not accepted in society, which makes such relationships fail. And they will end up with multiple partners.

17,"Seriously who really is objectified as sex objects ? Are you telling me main stream movies , series etc don‚Äôt objectify women. The item songs , the extremely double meaning jokes , the movies where there are heroines just for name sake ( for a song and to make the hero look cool ) ? Why do you think you find a item song in most movies and men just flock there , its to cater men who are the main audience to theatres and second shows .on what basis are you telling religion treats women as sex objects when its the other way round . Religion protects women from such exploitation it gives her a high status of something that is to be honoured , that without your beauty or being seen by dirty gazes of men with a disease in their heart you have an identity a voice and rights just like anyone else . Especially considering nowadays women are judged on the modern standards of beauty ( colour, body , etc ).And what do you mean women have no identity in religion? Religion teaches women to not wrap yourself around only one identity such as mother , daughter, sister , wife , friend, engineer, doctor, clerk , teacher , entrepreneur etc . Because with these kind of identities, we end up expecting from people and the world and it always lets us down so we don‚Äôt expect anything from people the creation of god but we expect only from god . And we retain all these several identities at the same time , if i am a mother i am a teacher at the same time but also i am a daughter, so I don‚Äôt tie my purpose to one thing because at some point my children, siblings, husband , parents will all let me down because humans are not perfect the only perfect thing is god and we please him by fulfilling all our duties and identities because he gives more than what we expect.",7,2 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS4qq7ExsfGKK1EXuvKVvzQ,rashika nizar
